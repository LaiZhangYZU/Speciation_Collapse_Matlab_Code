# Speciation_Collapse_Matlab_Code
The file describes the coding program in Maltab for the manuscript: Biodiversity loss through speciation collapse: mechanisms, warning signals, and possible rescue Main file is named ass FST_Parallel_Entry. Open this script, and you will three sections: speciation, Disturbance and environmental restor. Each section can run independently. The section of Speciation aims for the emergence of two incipient species pairs from homozygous individuals. Section of Disturbance runs with disturbance of certain level, which may give rise to speciation collapse. Section of environmental restor runs for possible re-emergence of species pair given that environment is restored.
